Traversing a folder structure
File systems are stored as a hierarchy, which means most directories (folders) have either a parent folder, or a child folder, or both!

To traverse down into a child folder from the current directory, you would use    cd [folder_name] which translates to: "Change directory to [folder_name]" where [folder_name] is the name of the child folder.

cd [folder name]
MacBook-Pro:desktop jbenammi$ cd JonathanBenAmmi
MacBook-Pro:JonathanBenAmmi jbenammi$



To traverse up to a parent folder from where you currently are, it's  cd .. (Pronounced: "cd dot dot")

cd ..
MacBook-Pro:JonathanBenAmmi$ cd ..
MacBook-Pro:desktop jbenammi$
